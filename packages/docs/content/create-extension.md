title: Create a Pushword Extension the easy way
h1: Create an extension
---

Each extension is build as a [symfony bundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles.html).

When you know that, you just have to learn how to make a bundle for symfony and you will know how to make an extension for Pushword.

There is some simple example like [flat](https://github.com/Pushword/Pushword/tree/main/packages/flat/) or more complex like [conversation](https://github.com/Pushword/Pushword/tree/main/packages/conversation/) (and more respecting the symfony best practices).
