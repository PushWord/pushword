There is multiple way to override the default theme.

My recommandation is to override it (partially or completly) by create a new `page_default.html.twig` in `./templates/{$host}/page`.

Then you can see how it's handle #[for the documentation](https://github.com/Pushword/Pushword/tree/main/packages/skeleton/templates/pushword.piedweb.com/page).
