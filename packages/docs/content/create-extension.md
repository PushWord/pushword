title: Create a Pushword Extension the easy way
h1: Create an extension
parent: extensions

Each extension is built as a [symfony bundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles.html).

When you know that, you just have to learn how to [create a bundle for symfony](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles.html) and you will know how to make an extension for Pushword.

There is some simple example like [flat](https://github.com/Pushword/Pushword/tree/main/packages/flat/) or more complex like [conversation](https://github.com/Pushword/Pushword/tree/main/packages/conversation/).

If you don't want to share your extension, you don't need to build a bundle, just go in `./src` and start coding following symfony concept.
